# Agricola
Agricola is a farm management app for market farmers and regenerative agriculturalists and ranchers. It focuses on the most basic farm reality: land. Land is designated for certain uses in sections called Beds in the case of a Garden or Rotations in the case of a Ranch. The app provides a top-down view of the Farm, as well as a Gantt chart for scheduling.

Agricola is a map. Never mistake the map for the terrain.
